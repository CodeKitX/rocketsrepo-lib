1. Loose thoughts on the project
    - Rocket and Mission would be entities in the target project so ID would come from a sequence generator
    - When adding multiple rockets to a mission if any of the rockets is already assigned non of the rockets is added - I figured this makes sense when planning a mission in space
    - Assuming mission is automatically started when rocket is assigned
    - Assuming that ending a mission resets rockets status to ON_GROUND unless the rocket is in repair
